    "How Dictionaries Store Data in Python\n",

    "                    and each key is associated with a specific value.The value can be of any data type, such as a string, number, list, or \n",
    "                    even another dictionary\n",
    "                    y_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}\n",

    "                    'Alice', 25, and 'New York' are the associated values.\n",
    "2) Key Uniqueness:\n",
    "Each key in a dictionary must be unique. If you try to insert a duplicate key, the previous key-value pair will be overwritten by the new one.  \n",
    "                my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}\n",

    "                \n",
    "3)Hashing and Fast Lookup: Internally, dictionaries use a hash table to store and manage data.\n",
    "        When a key is added to the dictionary, Python calculates a hash value for the key. \n",
    "        This hash value is used to determine where to store the key-value pair in memory, making lookups extremely fast.\n",
    "         The key is hashed into a unique index in the dictionary.\n",
    "        This allows Python to quickly locate the value associated with a given key,\n",

    "    In Python, strings are immutable because their contents cannot be changed once they are created. \n",
    "This design decision has several important benefits and reasons behind it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Performance Optimization:\n",
    "Memory Efficiency: Immutable objects are often more memory efficient because Python can reuse existing string objects \n",
    "                when the same string is encountered, reducing memory usage.\n",
    "                Caching: Python uses a technique called interning, where identical string literals are stored in a single memory location.\n",
    "                This would not be possible if strings were mutable.\n",
    "2. Thread Safety:\n",
    "        Immutable objects, such as strings, are inherently thread-safe because their state cannot be changed. \n",
    "        This eliminates the risk of one thread modifying the string while another thread is reading it,\n",
    "        which could lead to inconsistencies or errors in multithreaded programs.\n",
    "3. Consistency and Predictability:\n",
    "        When strings are immutable, you can rely on the fact that their value will remain unchanged throughout the program.\n",
    "        This makes them more predictable and reduces the risk of accidental modification or bugs.\n",
    "4. Simplicity:\n",
    "        Immutable types are simpler to implement and use in various data structures (e.g., as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets),\n",
    "        as they cannot be changed after creation, ensuring consistency.\n",
    "Example of Immutability:\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. **Order Matters**:\n",
    "   - **Lists** maintain the **order** of elements, meaning the order in which elements are added is preserved.\n",
    "   - If you need to access elements by **position** or **index**, lists are the better choice.\n",

    "### 3. **When You Need to Perform Sequential Operations**:\n",
    "   - If you need to iterate over all the elements in a specific order or need to append/remove elements frequently, **lists** are more suitable as they support **efficient operations** like `append()`, `remove()`, and slicing.\n",

    "19)Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, **dictionaries** are considered **unordered** because the **order** of key-value pairs is not guaranteed until Python 3.7. In versions prior to Python 3.7, dictionaries did not maintain the insertion order of items. However, starting from Python 3.7, dictionaries preserve the order of insertion, but they are still conceptually unordered because the keys are hashed, and their ordering is not inherent to their function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Dictionaries Are Considered Unordered**:\n",
    "1. **Hashing Mechanism**:\n",
    "   - Dictionaries use a **hash table** internally. When a key is inserted, it is hashed to a certain memory location based on its value,\n",
    "                which is used to store the key-value pair.\n",
    "   - The **order** in which keys are stored is not determined by their insertion order but by the hash function.\n",
    "   - The hashing process does not inherently maintain order; the key-value pairs are stored in memory locations determined by the hash values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pre-Python 3.7 Behavior**:\n",
    "   - In versions prior to Python 3.7, the dictionary did not guarantee any specific order. Keys and values could appear in a seemingly random order when iterating over the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Impact on Data Retrieval**:\n",
    "1. **Access by Key**:\n",
    "   - **Fast retrieval** of values by key is **O(1)** on average, regardless of the order in which the keys were inserted. Since dictionaries are unordered, the hash function enables constant-time lookups, meaning data retrieval does not depend on the order of insertion.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n",
    "   print(my_dict['b'])  # O(1) access, retrieving value by key 'b'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iteration**:\n",
    "   - In versions **prior to Python 3.7**, iterating over the dictionary may not give you the same order in which the keys were inserted, since the dictionary does not guarantee any specific order.\n",
    "   - In Python 3.7 and later, dictionaries maintain insertion order when iterating, but **order is not part of the dictionary's logic**, and should not be relied upon when considering the dictionary's primary function (key-value mapping).\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example** (Python 3.7+):\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n",
    "   for key, value in my_dict.items():\n",

    "   ```\n",

    "### **Summary**:\n",
    "- **Dictionaries** are considered unordered due to their **hash-based structure**, which does not inherently maintain the order of keys.\n",
    "- **Data retrieval** by key is fast (O(1) on average) because the order doesn't matter for access.\n",

    "1. **List**:\n",
    "   - Retrieval is by **index**.\n",
    "   - Supports **duplicate values**.\n",
    "   - Fast for accessing by index (O(1)).\n",
    "   - Slower for searching by value (O(n)).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dictionary**:\n",
    "   - Retrieval is by **key**.\n",
    "   - Keys must be **unique**, and you cannot have duplicate keys.\n",
    "   - Fast for accessing by key (O(1) on average).\n",
    "   - Does not support access by index (since it’s unordered).\n",

    "- **Dictionary**: Access by **key**, efficient for key-based lookups (O(1) average time), but does not support index-based access due to its unordered nature.\n",
